## PROBLEM STATEMENT
- In the era of growing demands for pharmaceutical and chemical products for health and medicine, every medical store, whether small or 
  medium-sized, faces the challenge of efficient store management and rapid revenue computation.
- Instead of relying on conventional paper-based records and documentation, electronic methods are increasingly preferred for:
  1. Stock maintenance
  2. Automatic updating of records during billing
  3. Reliable electronic documentation
- This software not only reduces daily manual effort and labor but also improves the operational efficiency.

## OBJECTIVE
- The primary aim of this project is to develop a software solution for the effective management of a pharmaceutical store's database. 
  This system will:
- Improve accuracy and enhance safety and efficiency in pharmaceutical operations.
- Assist pharmacists in maintaining records of medicines, user, and admin details.
- Enable pharmacists to check and renew the validity of medicines and manage orders placed by customers.
